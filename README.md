"# PYTH0N-PR0JECTS2" 
Below are the examples of Classical Ciphers. Now, what are Classical Ciphers?
Classical Ciphers are ciphers that predate computers and therefore work on letters rather than on bits. They are much simpler than a modern cipher like DES(DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD).
I implemented the Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher using the python Programming Language.
Do well to check out the code and feed me back if it needs any modification or addition @ 0xg0df4th3r.m3@proton.me
